Version 2.10.2-201511061603 is a maintenance release, intended to improve the floating point support for Cortex-M7, and to update the toolchain prefix for **Linaro AArch64 bare-metal ELF**.

## New features

* [[#32](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/32)] the Cortex-M7 specific FPU definitions `fpv5-d16` & `fpv5-sp-d16` were added to the Settings page;
* [[#33](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/33)] the toolchain prefix for **Linaro AArch64 bare-metal ELF** was updated from `aarch64-none-elf-` to `aarch64-elf-`; the change is effective for newly created projects; old projects require to reselect the toolchain for the update to be effective.

## Addressed bugs

* none.

## Template issues

* in certain conditions, the linker complained about a missing symbol (`__dso_handle`); added as weak to `_syscalls.c`.

## Other changes

* none.

## Known problems

* due to a copy/paste error, the default selection for the F7 processor is wrong and projects apparently configured for STM32F745xx are actually for the non-existing STM32F707xx and the build fails; the problem was fixed in the 2.11.1 release; as an workaround, explicitly select the processor even for STM32F745xx; fixed in 2.11.1-201512141335.
