## Quicklinks

If you know what this is all about:

- satisfy the [prerequisites]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/prerequisites/)
- go to the
[downloads](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.embed-cdt/downloads/)
page on the Eclipse server and download the latest package for your platform

{% include note.html content="Starting with 2020-12, the package is also
listed in the main Eclipse
[download packages](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) page." %}

## Overview

The recommended method to install new Eclipses with the plug-ins is to use
the **Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers** packages, which pack
together

- the **Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers** standard distribution with
- the **Eclipse Embedded CDT plug-ins**

## Benefits

Apart from a simplified installation, using the package also sets more
**convenient defaults** to most global preferences, so the later workspace
customisations are simplified.

## Multiple Eclipses

Eclipse is distributed as a standalone folder, which encourages
to have multiple instances installed, actually as many as necessary.

So, instead of installing a single instance in a system location, and
then adding all possible plug-ins for all possible applications, it is
recommended to install one Eclipse for each application, thus reducing
the risk of incompatible plug-ins.

## Prerequisites

**Java 11 JDK**; please follow the steps in the
[prerequisites]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/prerequisites/) page.

## Download the Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers package

To get the **Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers** package, go to the
pproject [downloads](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.embed-cdt/downloads/)
page and select the correct binary for your platform (Windows, macOS or
GNU/Linux).

To install Eclipse, simply unpack the archive at a place of your choice and
start using it.

{% include warning.html content="On GNU/Linux
**DO NOT** try to install Eclipse via the package manager, since usually
you get an older version and the CDT plug-ins are not included." %}

{% include note.html content="Contrary to other tools, Eclipse **does not
need administrative rights**, does need not be installed in a system location,
and does not need not be a single instance on a system. Actually you are
encouraged to install multiple instances of Eclipse, possibly one for
each project type, to avoid mixing plug-ins from different sources in
case different project types." %}

### macOS security notice

On macOS, if you download the archive with the browser, the strict
security checks on recent macOS will prevent it to run. The fix is
simple, you need to remove the `com.apple.quarantine` extended attribute.

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine eclipse-embedcdt-*-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.tar.gz
```

After un-archiving, if the Eclipse.app still does not run, check/remove
the attribute from the Eclipse.app folder too:

```console
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine Eclipse.app
```

## Alternate ways

For special use cases, it is possible to install the **Eclipse
Embedded CDT plug-ins** on top of an existing Eclipse, via the Eclipse
Marketplace, or the Eclipse **Install New Software** mechanism.

For details, please check the separate
[Alternate Installs]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/install-alternate/) page.

## Check/set the global tools paths

If you already installed the toolchain (and, on Windows, the build tools)
in the default locations, as suggested in the prerequisites steps, the
plug-ins might have automatically discovered them.

![Global Tools Path]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/win-preferences-c-build-global-tools-path.png)

The above definition will make the toolchain and build tools accessible
to all projects in all workspaces.

If needed, you can define different paths per workspace (**Workspace
Tools Paths**) or even per project (**Tools Paths** in the project properties).

To check if the paths definitions are effective, go to the project
properties page and identify the `PATH` variable. Be sure the **Origin**
column reads `BUILD SYSTEM`; if you manually edit it, the Origin will
change and will read `USER`, but this is strongly not recommended,
since manually editing the path disables further automated updates of the path.

## Set workspace preferences

After completing the installation it is recommended to
[set the workspace preference]({{ site.baseurl }}/eclipse/workspace/preferences/).

## Toolchain and debugging support

By completing the above steps, the Eclipse environment is ready, and you
can start creating projects right away. However, for being able to build
and debug these projects, you also need to install:

- the [Arm toolchain](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/install/) or
[RISC-V toolchain](https://xpack.github.io/riscv-none-embed-gcc/install/)
- the optional [build tools](https://xpack.github.io/windows-build-tools/)
(if you are running on Windows)
- the [debugging]({{ site.baseurl }}/debug/) tools

## The CMSIS Packs Manager

It is also recommended to install the Packs plug-in, to switch to the Packs
perspective and using the
[CMSIS Packs manager]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/packs-manager/) to install
the packages related to the devices in use. Even if Packs support is not
complete, you still can benefit from the existing CMSIS Packs, for example
by using the
[peripherals registers view]({{ site.baseurl }}/debug/peripheral-registers/)
in debug, the documentation view in the C/C++ perspective, etc.

## Download CMSIS Packs

Simply installing the CMSIS Packs manger is not enough, you need to
update the list of available packs and to install the desired ones.

For this follow the steps in the
[CMSIS Packs manager]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/packs-manager/) page.

## Create a test project

Before proceeding to create your own projects, it is highly recommended
to create a test blinky project, and to run it via the QEMU emulator.

This validates that the plug-ins are installed properly, that the toolchain
is available, and the debug plug-ins are available and configured properly.

Follow the steps in the
[Create a Blinky Arm test project]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/blinky-arm/)
page.

## Support

If you encountered any problems when installing the plug-ins, please refer to
the [Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/) page and **do not** send private
emails.
