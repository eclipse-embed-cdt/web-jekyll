In August 2021, GitHub made the new Discussions feature available for all projects ([blog](https://github.blog/2021-08-17-github-discussions-out-of-beta/)).

Given the ease of use and better integration, the
Eclipse Embedded CDT support pages were migrated from the
[Tapatalk forum](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/) to
[GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/discussions/).

There are separate categories for different plug-ins **Q&A**,
**general discussions**, **ideas**, etc.

The Tapatalk forums are now deprecated and can no longer be used.
