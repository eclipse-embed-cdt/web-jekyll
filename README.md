# The Eclipse Embedded CDT web site - Jekyll sources

## Overview

This GitHub project, available from
[eclipse-embed-cdt/web-jekyll](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/web-jekyll),
contains the source files used to generate the
**Eclipse Embedded CDT web site**.

## Public URLs

The **Eclipse Embedded CDT web site** is an organisation specific
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) site, publicly available from:

- http://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io
- http://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io/web-preview/ (for preview of
new pages only, do not bookmark it)

## Jekyll

The web site is generated off-line by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
It cannot be generated by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
because it uses Jekyll plug-ins, considered unsafe and disabled by
the GitHub Pages instance of Jekyll.

## Folder structure

### Posts

All blog posts are in the `_posts` folder, with specific pages in `plugins`,
`project`, `web`, `articles`, etc.

### Drafts

Drafts are posts you’re still working on and don’t want to publish yet.
They are stored in the `_drafts` folder and later moved to `_posts` when ready.

To preview your site with drafts, simply run jekyll with the `--drafts` switch.

### Pages

All web pages are in the `pages` folder, with specific pages in `plugins`,
`debug`, etc.

## Page modified timestamp

To maintain sitelink.xml usefulness, while maintaining pages and posts,
it is necessary to keep the `last_updated` timestamp up-to-date.

This is updated by the `scripts/adjust-timestamps.sh` script.

TODO: activate the plug-in and migrate to `last_modified_at:` to automate the
process.

## Timezone

As per `_config.yml`, the default timezone is UTC. For other timezones,
set it explicitly as offset (for example +0300)
