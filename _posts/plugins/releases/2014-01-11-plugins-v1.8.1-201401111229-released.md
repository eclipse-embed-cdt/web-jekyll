The main changes are **the addition of the STM32F0x templates**, the possibility to use the plug-in even for **non-managed (Makefile) projects**, and the possibility to use **the internal builder** (except for generating the listing file).

New features:

* [feature-request:#23] the **STM32F0x** template was added.

Bugs:

* [bugs:#71] the **STM32F4x** family has different **ram sizes**; the template was updated to automatically generate the correct mem.ld file
* [bugs:#72] the **FPU Type** configuration, when automatically set by a change to FP hard in FPU ABI, was not persistent; fixed
* [bugs:#73] the latest version of newlib, packed with GCC 4.8, makes use of `__end__`, which was not defined in the STM32Fx templates; `__end__` and `__end` were added to sections.ld
* [bugs:#74] the values of `-T "script.ld"` are always quoted, even on Unix
* changing toolchains in the Eclipse toolchain editor is now functional, even from an empty toolchain (project generated by ProcessorExpert).

New features:

* the **Toolchain** settings tab in the C/C++ settings section is now visible even for **non-mananged (Makefile) projects**, to allow the configuration of the toolchain used by the indexer.

Other changes:

* the structure of the projects generated from the STM32Fxx templates was simplified, only the **src** and the **libs** folders are marked as sources
* [support-requests:#35] the STM32F4x template was updated to use the **v1.3.0 standard peripheral library** from STM
* more explanations regarding the tracing environment were added as comments in **trace_impl.h**
* by default the **listing file** is no longer created, to reduce the build time
* the version scheme changed, the minor number is now increased with each release
  * site increased from 1.1.7 to 1.8.1
  * cross increased from 1.1.6 to 1.7.1
  * stm increased from 1.1.5 to 1.6.1
  * template core renamed from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1
