## Quicklinks

- [xPack Forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/) - the best source
  for support; be sure you select the right group/discussion.
- [xPack Core & Tools support](https://xpack.github.io/support/)

## Embedded CDT plug-ins issues

In case you encounter problems while using the Eclipse plug-ins, please
consider the following:

- read carefully the documentation pages
- check the release pages for **Known issues**
- check the **FAQ** pages
- check the [forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/) for
  discussions on similar subjects
- check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues) trackers

### Use the forums

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, please use the
[forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/), and be sure you
select the right group/discussion.

### Use the chat room

For live discussions between users, you can use the
[xPack chatroom](https://gitter.im/xpack/community).
This may be a great way to share experience, but for support
the forums are preferred.

### Use the GitHub Issues trackers only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug (if you have doubts,
use the forums), or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance
the xPack tools, please use the specific GitHub Issues trackers:

- [eclipse-plugins](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/)

**DO NOT** use the GitHub Issues for questions and support, use the forums.

## Web pages issues

If you discover problems in the content of these pages (typos,
wrong phrasing, etc), or you have suggestions on how to improve them,
you can fork and send a **Pull Request** for the
[Web Source project](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/web-jekyll/)
or use the
[Web Source Issues](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/web-jekyll/issues/) tracker.

## Use of private e-mail

Please, please, please: **do not use private e-mail for support**,
since such messages will be automatically replied with a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to efficiently use
the time; since forum posts and GitHub Issues are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
