The main change is **the addition of the STM32F3x template**, that generates a fully configurable running sample, based on the original standard peripheral libraries (`STM32F30x_DSP_StdPeriph_Lib_V1.0.0` from the stsw-stm32108.zip archive and `STM32F37x_DSP_StdPeriph_Lib_V1.0.0` from stsw-stm32115.zip).

Bugs fixed:

* [bugs:#62] the (*.bss.*) was missing in linker scripts; added
* [bugs:#64] changing the _rm_ command regenerates the makefile
* [bugs:#63] ~~updating the toolchain settings for multiple configurations at once is now possible~~ (partial solution, fully fixed in 1.1.6).

Other changes since the previous version:

* the stm32f4 template startup code was rewriten in C and generally improved
* the stm32f1 template was updated to match the f4 new template style
* the templates are able to output trace messages via SWO, semihosting output or semihosting debug
* the .noinit section was added to template linker scripts.
