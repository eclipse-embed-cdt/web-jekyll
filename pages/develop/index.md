## Developer

### Work in progress

The developer pages will be migrated/updated in a next iteration.

For the moment use the [old pages](https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/developer/)
which are mostly outdated, but better than nothing.

## How to build

To locally build the Eclipse plug-ins and run a debug session, it is
necessary to install an Eclipse and possibly some other tools.
