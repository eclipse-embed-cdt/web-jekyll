Version 2.4.2-201411261616 is a maintenance release; the main improvements include support for **Peripherals** view in the **OpenOCD** debug plug-in and the **newlib-nano** explicit configuration options.

New features:

* [feature-requests:#73] the **Peripherals** view is now visible in **OpenOCD** too
* in the C/C++ Build settings, the linker configuration was extended with explicit options to configure the **newlib-nano**, including setting the **_printf_float** and **_scanf_float** symbols
* [feature-requests:#70] the standard Eclipse preference mechanism is now the default mechanism for setting various defaults (more info in the wiki)
* [feature-requests:#72] the `${jlink_path}` is automatically set to the install folder of J-Link, by reading the Windows registry or searching several folders (on macOS or GNU/Linux)
* the `${openocd_path}` is automatically set to the install folder of OpenOCD, by searching several folders
* the **Cortex-M7** architecture was added to the compiler list of supported architectures.

The following bugs were addressed:

* [bugs:#128] when closing the **Peripherals** view, the memory monitors were not disposed; fixed.
* [support-requests:#81] in certain erroneous conditions the debug session hanged; the error processing in the Peripherals view was improved and the problem fixed
* if packs un-archiving failed, the incomplete folders were erroneously preserved; fixed, no partially installed packs left
* in certain conditions, the value for the `fpu_unit=` build option was not appropriate; reset to default.

In the projects generated by the templates, the following issues were addressed:

* [bugs:#129] in the startup code, the data area copy check had a bug related to DATA_END_GUARD_VALUE; fixed
* the origin of the flash area in the memory map for the generic **Hello World ARM Cortex-M C/C++  Project** was not 0x0; fixed
* the ST HAL library assumes that the SysTick handler is always present and returns; the empty default SysTick handler now returns
* for the large STM32 cores (F3, F4), the startup code was not able to initialise **multiple RAM regions**, as .data & .bss; fixed; fixed, a new mechanism based on tables was added to startup.c
* the file **_write.c**, previously located in the system folders was moved to the application folder, since its content is application dependant.
