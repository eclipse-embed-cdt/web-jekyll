Version 1.1.7-201312241058 is a maintenance release.

Bugs fixed:

* [bugs:#68] the path processing for the J-Link plug-in was fixed, now both the GDB client and the GDB server paths can include spaces
* [bugs:#69] the path processing for the linker `-T` option in the build plug-in was fixed, now the linker scripts can be referred with paths including spaces
* the J-link plug-in no longer allows to enable the SWO output parsing if the interface is not SWD.
