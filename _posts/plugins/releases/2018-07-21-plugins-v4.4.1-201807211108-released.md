## Known problems

- due to some changes in the newlib packed with GCC 7.3.x,
the definition of the `_EXFUN` macro changed
and the semihosting projects fail to build with a compile error in
`system/src/newlib/_syscalls.c`. The problem is in the project template
[#317](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/317), and
a fix will be available in the next release of GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins.
