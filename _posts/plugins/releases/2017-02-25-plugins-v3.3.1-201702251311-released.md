## New features

* [[Issue:#180](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/180)] support the latest architectures and devices:
  * the `-march=` option was extended to include `armv8.1-a`, `armv8.1-a+crc` (from GCC 6.2)
  * the `-mcpu=` option was extended to include `cortex-m23`, `cortex-m33`, `cortex-a17`, `cortex-a32`, `cortex-a35`, `cortex-a72`, `qdf24xx` (from GCC 6.2)
* [[Issue:#179](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/179)] on macOS and Linux, the search path for the toolchain/OpenOCD/QEMU executables was extended with `${user.home}/opt`; this is the new recommended location for installing optional tools; 
* [[Issue:#182](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/182)] the initial logic to compute the default toolchain was based on the lexicographic order of folder names; due to changes in the naming conventions, this logic failed to identify the latest ARM GCC 6 release; the logic was changed and now it uses the date of the `arm-none-eabi-gcc` file;
* [[Issue:#177](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/177)] the J-Link debugging plug-in was extended to accept IP tunneling configurations (the IP field was extended to accept the `:` character);
* [[Issue:#174](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/174)] to help identify problems when launching external executables (like the J-Link/OpenOCD/QEMU GDB servers and the GDB client), the entire command line is logged to the `${workspace}/.metadata/.log` file.

## Addressed bugs

* [[Issue:#170](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/170)] in the QEMU debugging plug-in, changing only the **Device Name:** was not enough to enable the Apply button; fixed;
* [[PR #176](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/pull/176)] the target override combo box in the pyOCD Debugger pane was not being set to the saved value when the debug config was edited; also wrapped some prints with a check for debugging being enabled;
* [[Issue:#181](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/181)] avoid Eclipse [bug 512550](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=512550), affecting the **New C/C++ Project** wizard; the project is now created with the default toolchain even if the wizard does not reach the page to select the toolchain;
* [[Issue:#175](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/175)] in the C/C++ Build → Settings → Tools Settings → Print Size → General, in certain conditions, the **Hex** field was not visible; fixed;
* [[Issue:#173](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/173)] attempts to run an OpenOCD debug session without starting the server failed if the **Config options:** field was empty; fixed, the content of the field is ignored if the **Start OpenOCD locally** is disable;

## Template changes

* none.

## Other changes

* none.

## Known problems

* on Neon.2, when using GDB 7.12 from GCC 6.x, the Suspend and Terminate buttons are not functional and it is not possible to interrupt a running debug session; the problem is not related to the GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins, but a bug in Eclipse CDT 9.2; the bug was eventually fixed in CDT 9.2.1 packed with Neon.3, due in March 2017; as a temporary workaround, better use GDB 7.10, from GCC 5.x. 
* the default for architectures was inadvertedly changed to cortex-m33; fixed in 3.4.1.
