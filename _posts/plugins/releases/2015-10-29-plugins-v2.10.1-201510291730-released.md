## New features

* [GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD v0.10.0-20151028*-dev released]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2015/10/28/openocd-v0.10.0-20151028-dev-released/);
* [GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU v2.4.50-20151029*-dev released]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2015/10/29/qemu-v2-4-50-20151029-released/);
*  [[SF features-request#103](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/feature-requests/103/)] a template for the current STM32F7 family was added, with support for STM32746G-EVAL and STM32F746G-DISCO;
* [[SF features-request#107](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/feature-requests/107/)] Analog Devices contributed a template for the ADuCM36[01] devices;
* [[SF features-request#108](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/feature-requests/108/)] the generic Cortex-M template was extended to also create Cortex-M7 projects;
* [[#13](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/13)] the **Devices** tab is now visible to all projects, not only those generated by GNU ARM Eclipse.

## Addressed bugs

* [[SF bugs#195](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/bugs/195/)] the content of the **Toolchains** tab was not updated when the build configuration changed; fixed.

## Template issues

* the **CMSIS Core** was updated to v4.4;
* the **STM32F4 HAL** was updated to v1.9.0;
* the implementation of `assert_failed()` was made `weak`, to allow redefinitions.

## Other changes

* part of the **µOS++ III** code used by the templates (ARM Core, STM32F4 CMSIS, STM32F4 HAL) was migrated to separate packages, available in the GitHub project [xPacks](https://github.com/xpacks). Eventually the entire dependency on **µOS++ III** will be migrated to separate packages.

## Known problems

* none so far
