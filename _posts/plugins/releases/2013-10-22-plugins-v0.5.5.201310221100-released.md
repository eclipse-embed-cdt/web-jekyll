Although for 0.5.5 there are no further improvements planed, due to a bug report [[bugs:#56](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/bugs/56/)], it was necessary to release a maintenance version, to correct the bug.

The bug was introduced only in 0.5.5.201310111213, when the build procedure changed from Eclipse Update site to Maven Tycho, to match the build procedure of version 1.x.

Due to a wrong .classpath inherited from the Eclipse build, access to java classes inside the plug-in was impossible, and functionality was severely impacted.

The .classpath was fixed and the entire build procedure was checked to work with Maven.

For convenience, this version is packed together with 1.1.2.201310221203.
