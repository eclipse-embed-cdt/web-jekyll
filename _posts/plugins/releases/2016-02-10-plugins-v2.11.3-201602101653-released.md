## Addressed bugs

* [[Issue:#65](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/65)] during project creation, sometimes functions from the templates.core plugin were invoked before the plug-in was properly initialised, and project creation failed with an exception; fixed by enabling lazy activation for the templates.core plug-in.

## Other changes

* none.

## Known problems

* none.
