## Quick links

- GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/discussions/) - the best source
  for support; be sure you select the right category.
- [xPack Core & Tools support](https://xpack.github.io/support/)

## Embedded CDT plug-ins issues

In case you encounter problems while using the Eclipse plug-ins, please
consider the following:

- read carefully the documentation pages
- check the release pages for **Known issues**
- check the [Known issues]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/known-issues/) pages
- check the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/faq/) pages
- check the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/discussions/)
  for discussions on similar subjects
- check the (now deprecated) Tapatalk [forums](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/xpack/)
- check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues) trackers

### Use the GitHub Discussions

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, please use the
[GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/discussions/)
pages, and be sure you select the right category.

### Use the chat room

For live discussions between users, you can use the
[project chat room](https://gitter.im/xpack/community).
This may be a great way to share experience, but for support
the discussions are preferred.

### Use the GitHub Issues trackers only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug (if you have doubts,
use the discussions), or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance
the xPack tools, please use the specific GitHub Issues trackers:

- [eclipse-plugins](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/)

**DO NOT** use the GitHub Issues for questions and support, use the discussions.

## Web pages issues

If you discover problems in the content of these pages (typos,
wrong phrasing, etc), or you have suggestions on how to improve them,
you can fork and send a **Pull Request** for the
[Web Jekyll project](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/web-jekyll/)
or use the
[Web Jekyll Issues](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/web-jekyll/issues/) tracker.

## Use of private e-mail

{% include important.html content="Please, please, please: **do not use
private e-mail** for support, **use the
GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/discussions/)**." %}

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to use
the time more efficiently; since discussions are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
