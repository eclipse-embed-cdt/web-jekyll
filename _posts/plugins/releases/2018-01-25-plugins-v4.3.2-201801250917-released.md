Version 4.3.2-201801250917 is a maintenance release; the main addition is **support for semihosting in the SiFive RISC-V project template**.

## Semihosting for RISC-V projects

The SiFive RISC-V project template was extended to support semihositing for two purposes:

* as a destination for the `trace::printf()` infrastructure
* for fully semihosted projects, intended for running unit tests on RISC-V hardware.

To run applications that use semihosting, a recent OpenOCD is required; **GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD** supports semihosting since version [v0.10.0-7-20180123]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2018/01/23/openocd-v0-10-0-7-20180123-released/).

To activate semihosting in OpenOCD, use:

```
arm semihosting enable
```

The Eclipse OpenOCD debug plug-in has a check button in the Startup tab.

To pass command line options to the target application:

```
arm semihosting_cmdline argv0 argv1 argv2 argv3 ...
```

In the Eclipse OpenOCD debug plug-in, add the command prefixed with `monitor`:

## New features

## Addressed bugs

## Template changes

* [Issue:[#269](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/269)] The STM32F7 template did not generate code to set the `PLLR` register for larger devices, which resulted in an assertion error during runtime; code to initialise `PLLR` was conditionally added to the initialisation routine.
* [Issue:[#268](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/268)] Support for semihosting trace was added to the SiFive template
* [Issue:[#272](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/272)] For SiFive projects that use semihosing, the `arm semihosting` option is automatically enabled in the OpenOCD launcher
* [Issue:[#273](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/273)] Support for full semihosting was added to the SiFive template
* [Issue:[#274](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/274)] To slightly optimise the build time, unused device files in the SiFive template are excluded from build
* a J-Link launcher was added to the SiFive template for the projects running on the Arty board; at the time of this release, support for E31ARTY is already available from SEGGER, with support for E51ARTY planned
* the SiFive template was thoroughly tested and proved to build correctly in all possible combinations, so the _Experimental_ label was removed.

## Other changes

* none

## Known problems

* [2018-01-30] sometime in the previous two versions, while adding support for xPack devices, a bug affecting the CMSIS devices was introduced, and in certain conditions the peripheral viewer shows no content; the bug was fixed in the pre-release v4.3.3; to try it, **Install New Software...** from the test update URL (http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/v4-neon-updates-test).
