Version 2.5.1-201412191510 is a new release; the main improvements include a **more reliable J-Link GDB server startup** code and an **improved Peripherals** view, also handling **enumerated fields**.

[Binary files »]({{ page.download_url }})

New features:

* the code used to start the **J-Link GDB server** was rewritten for a more reliable error processing; for the best user experience, some changes were also required in the SEGGER software, currently available only in beta (V4.95e); with this new version, the **Other options** required to start the GDB server are `-singlerun -strict -timeout 0`;
* in the **Peripheral** memory monitor rendering, the **enumerated fields** now also show the enumeration value, and the list of available enumerations is also used when entering values for the field;
* in the **Peripheral** memory monitor rendering, writing a register might have affected the content of other registers too; for more accurate viewing, **the entire content of the Peripheral is updated** after a register write;
* in the **Peripheral** memory monitor rendering, the functionality of the first two columns (name and address) was extended, and **the columns are sortable**, ascending and descending, by clicking on the table header;
* the `-fno-move-loop-invariants` option was added to the common **C/C++ Settings** → **Optimisations** group, for use on Debug, especially with `-Og`; without it, parts of the code were moved outside the loop making tracing jumpy, and sometimes interfering with breakpoint placement.

The following bugs were addressed:

* in the **Peripheral** monitor, the functionality of the **write-only fields** was erroneously preventing reading the registers; as per ARM specs, reading is allowed and usually returns zero; writing zero is not effective; with the above clarifications, using read/modify/write cycles to update write/only fields is no longer a problem and works as expected;
* the source of problems when running the plug-ins on **Luna** was identified, it is a **bug in Eclipse**, that was triggered by the **Restart** button; until the Eclipse bug is fixed, the workaround was to rewrite the Restart button code; unfortunately not all Eclipse problems could be avoided (see the Known problems section);
* in the **SVD parser**, the function used to process ScaledNonNegative values was not parsing binary values marked with #; fixed;
* in the **SVD parser**, in certain conditions, some `derivedFrom=` definitions were not used properly; fixed, now all inheritance cases are implemented;
* [support-requests:#89 & 86] in the **Packs installer**, in certain network conditions, the package download fails, the result being **incomplete archives** that cannot be processed; due to the cache used, the incomplete file was not downloaded again, making installing fail repeatedly; fixed, the cached archive is now removed in case of unpack error to allow a new download;
* the **Apply** button in the **C/C++ Settings** → **Devices** tab in did not function properly; fixed
* after the move to Luna, some internal exceptions related to error processing were discovered in the debug plug-ins; fixed, improving error processing.

In the projects generated by the templates, the following issues were addressed:

* [bugs:#131] in certain conditions, the `–specs=nano.specs` option was added twice to the linker line; fixed, now only the boolean option is set by the templates;
* [bugs:#135] in certain conditions, the **vectors** in the **STM32F4 projects** were missing some definitions, and in other conditions the definitions were not for the current sub-family; fixed, now the vectors should compile without errors or warnings;
* some defaults used by the **Cortex-M template** were not correct; fixed;
* for more consistency with the other folders, the CMSIS name was changed to lower case **cmsis**.

Known problems:

* the **Luna Eclipse bug** could not be avoided entirely; due to an enabling problem, the first time the **Restart button** is used, an information message box is displayed, claiming the **button is not enabled**; clicking the same button again works as expected;
* the new `HardFault_Handler` (used to display the registers on failure) does not compile on Cortex-M0 cores and need to be commented out.

Many thanks to [Infineon](http://www.infineon.com/) for supporting the development of the debug plug-ins.
