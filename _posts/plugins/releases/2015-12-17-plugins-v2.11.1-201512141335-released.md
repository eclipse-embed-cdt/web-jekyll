## New features

* all templates were updated to use CMSIS CORE 4.5
* [[#33](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/33)] the toolchain prefix for **Linaro AArch64 big-endian bare-metal ELF** was updated from `aarch64_be-none-elf-` to `aarch64_be-elf-`; the change is effective for newly created projects; old projects require to reselect the toolchain for the update to be effective.
* [[#41](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/41)] an extension point was added to the managed build plug-in to allow third party plug-ins to define toolchains.

## Addressed bugs

* the button to disable graphics in the QEMU debugging plug-in was not functional; fixed;
* [[#40](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/40)] the _Linker flags_ present in the C linker were missing in the C++ linker settings page; added;

## Template issues

* in certain conditions, the STM32F7 template had problems with F745 projects; fixed;

## Other changes

* none.

## Known problems
