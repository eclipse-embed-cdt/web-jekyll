Version 4.1.1-201707111115 is a major release; thanks to a contribution from [SiFive](https://www.sifive.com), the project was enhanced with support for [RISC-V](https://riscv.org) devices and, to better reflect the multi-platform nature, was rebranded **GNU MCU Eclipse**.

**Important**: the public URL for the new v4.x Eclipse update site is (`http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/v4-neon-updates/`).

## New features

* a new build plug-in that allows to create and manage RISC-V projects was added
* the plug-ins are also packed together with the current **Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers Neon.3** distribution; the binaries are available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/org.eclipse.epp.packages/releases).

* explicit support for `--specs=nosys.specs`  added to both ARM and RISC-V plug-ins
* a new RISC-V only repository was added at `http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/riscv-v4-neon-updates/`

## Addressed bugs

* none

## Template changes

* none

## Other changes

* the minimum requirements were raised to **Eclipse 4.6 Neon.3**, with **Java 1.8**; 
* with the addition of the RISC-V build plug-in, common ARM & RISC-V code was re-structured
* the preferences and properties pages to configure paths were moved from **C/C++** and **Run/Debug** under a common **MCU** page; separate pages for the ARM toolchain, RISC-V toolchain, Windows Build Tools, SEGGER J-Link, OpenOCD, pyOCD are available;

* the mechanism used to configure the debug plug-ins was migrated from Eclipse strings to dynamic variables; macros like `${cross_prefix}` are all internal and are no longer present in the Run/Debug -> String Substitution preference page for inadvertent changes;
* the update sites were migrated from SourceForge to [Bintray](https://bintray.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/v4-neon-updates); the new public URL for v4.x is (`http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/v4-neon-updates/`) and will be automatically redirected to the new server; currently there are no more functional dependencies on SourceForge;

## Known problems

* the new plug-ins cannot be installed on older Eclipses; for this, use the latest 3.x version, available from the deprecated update site (`http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates`);
* the new plug-ins have IDs prefixed with `ilg.gnumcueclipse.`, while the old IDs were prefixed with `ilg.gnuarmeclipse.`; being completely different, this allows to install the new plug-ins alongside the old ones, but this should be avoided, and the old plug-ins should be manually uninstalled; preferably a new Eclipse instance should be used.
