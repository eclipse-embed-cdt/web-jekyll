## Major bugs

### Editing the toolchain may damage the project

In certain conditions, **changing the toolchain** for a project in the
**C/C++ Build** → **Tool Chain Editor** page from another plug-in to
Eclipse Embedded CDT plug-in might not work; even worse, there are cases
when the project is permanently damaged. There is not known way to repair
such a broken project; you have to create a new project and copy the
content (this is a CDT bug, not a plug-in bug).

## Annoying bugs

### Build fails after rename

Due to a problem buried deep into Eclipse, in certain conditions,
immediately after renaming a project, right clicking on a project and
choosing **Build Configurations** → **Build All**, will display an
error window, claiming that the project that the renamed project no
longer exist:

![Rename error]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2013/10/renameError.jpg)

The problem is related to a caching mechanism, and is easily cured by
exiting Eclipse and opening it again. Another solution is to close only
the renamed project and to reopen it.

### Add Global Variables... is disabled

In the J-Link or OpenOCD sessions, the Variables view does not allow
to add global variables. This is a known CDT DSF bug
[219040](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=219040), not a
plug-in bug. As a workaround, you can use watch expressions.

### The internal builder fails while generating the listing

Due to a CDT bug, when using the Internal builder it is not possible
to generate the additional program listing. If you need it, it is
recommended to enable the **External builder** in the project
**Properties** → **C/C++ Build** → **Builder Settings** tab → **Builder type**.

The **Internal builder** is long deprecated, it was no longer
maintained by the CDT team for many years, and it is strongly
recommended **not** to use it at all. 

### Conflict while editing tools

Due to a CDT bug, selecting tools in the toolchain editor (the
project **Properties** → **C/C++ Build** → **Tool Chain Editor** →
**Select Tools...** button)

![Select Tools]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2013/10/SelectTools.png)

complains about a tool conflict:

![Benign tool conflict message]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2013/10/ToolConflict.png)

The message is benign, being triggered by an improper test in CDT (all
these extra steps have as input the .elf generated by the linker, and
this condition is flagged as error by CDT). You can safely ignore it.

### Binaries not visible after build

Due to an Eclipse bug, in certain conditions, after project **Build All**,
the generated binaries, do not show in the Project Explorer. A manual
**Refresh** makes them visible.

### References to old project name after renaming

Due to a CDT bug, after renaming a project, the Problems window will
complain _Invalid project path: Missing project folder or file_ referring
to the old name. The problem can be cured by closing and reopening the project.

## Other problems

### The Restart button

Due to some bugs in Eclipse, the implementation of his simple button
has encountered several problems. Depending on the version you are
using, the first time you click this button you might get a message
box informing that the button was not enabled. Ignore this message,
close the message box and click the button again, this time it’ll
be effective.

### Tool Settings window update

Not really a bug, but sometimes perceived like an unusual behaviour,
enabling/disabling the secondary tools in the **C/C++ Build** →
**Settings → Toolchains** page and immediately switching to the
**Tool Settings** tab does not show/hide the new tools. It is
necessary to press the **Apply** button for this change to be effective.

### Map and listing not removed by Clean

The linker `.map` and the assembler `.lst` files are not removed when
running the project **Clean** process. Since these are specific tool
options and not makefile targets, the build process does not know about
them and is not able to remove them when executing the clean target.
Usually these files are generated during each build, so after successful
builds they should always be up to date. If the build does not complete,
it is possible to still have some of these files around, from the previous
build, and this may be confusing. In such cases it is recommended to
manually remove them, or, even better, to completely remove the
Debug/Release build folder and start a clean build.

## Advices (to avoid problems)

### Toolchain path

**DO NOT add the toolchain path** to the system path, especially if
you are using multiple toolchains (and if you do not do it yet, it
is very likely that you will, as soon as new versions of the toolchains
will be available). The toolchain path should be configured for each
toolchain in the **Toolchains** tab, in the **C/C++ Build** →
**Settings** page.
