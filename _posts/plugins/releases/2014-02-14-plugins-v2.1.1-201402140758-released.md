The main change (marked by the increase of the major number to 2.x) is that **debugging support** in GNU ARM Eclipse became **official** (the previous Experimental status was removed), with two variants, for a professional product (the **SEGGER J-Link**) and for the major open source solution (**OpenOCD**). Another important change was the addition of **Freescale templates**.

New features:

* the debug plug-in for **OpenOCD** was added
* the **Freescale KLxx template** was added, currently with KL25 and KL46 members implemented; it can generate _blinky/empty_ projects, in 3 variants (standalone/retargetting/semihosting)
* the **Freescale Processor Expert template** was added; it can generate projects that use the Processor Expert tools; invoking the PEx wizard automatically will be possible from vPEx_DRV_10.4 up
* [feature-request:#30] significant project **portability improvements**: in the build plug-in, the toolchain path mechanism was changed and made more explicit; it allows to define one path for each toolchain, and also, upon explicit request, one path for each project; no more path stored in .cproject.

Bugs fixed:

* [bugs:#77] passing multiple options in JLinkGDBServer ‘Other options’ failed; fixed, multiple options are properly parsed and split into separate options
* [bugs:#79] on Windows, the JLinkGDBServer console displayed an extra line feed; fixed by SEGGER
* [bugs:#75] typo in the Compiler Optimization settings text (independednt); fixed.

Other changes in the J-Link plug-in:

* based on SEGGER suggestions and validation tests, the J-Link plug-in was updated to pass the main parameters (interface, device, endianness) only as command line arguments to the JLinkGDBServer, and not as monitor commands
* [feature-request:#27] in the J-Link configuration interface, new fields were added to **select the connection method (USB or IP)**
* in the J-Link dialog with the server, the `monitor clrbp` (clear breakpoints) and `monitor regs` (display registers) commands were added during the reset sequence
* in the J-Link interface, the SWO mask field also accepts hex values
* the JLinkGDBServer default connection speed set to 30kHz.

Other changes:

* in the J-Link and OpenOCD configuration interfaces, additional options can be passed to the GDB client, using a new text field
* [feature-request:#26] in the build plug-in, the code used to add/edit linker scripts was changed to allow browsing
* the GNU ARM C/C++ templates are now associated only with the GNU ARM Eclipse build plug-in
* improved C++ support was added to all templates; when the project type is C++, the main file is created as main.cpp instead of main.c.
