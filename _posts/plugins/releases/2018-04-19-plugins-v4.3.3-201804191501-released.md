## New features

* [Issue:[#289](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/289)] The initial approach to identify the toolchain was to store the full name in `.cproject`, and from it to compute the numeric ID; this does not allow to rename the toolchain in the future; to overcome this, the numeric toolchain ID is now stored in `.cproject` and future versions will prefer it to the full name;
* [Issue:[#288](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/288)] Support for the new [GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc) toolchain was added, including the logic to select the path based on the xPack version;
* [Issue:[#270](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/270)] Modern GCC versions allows to define the path of additional system folders, via the `-isystem` command line option; the managed build **Settings** pages were extended with an widget to define the list of system folders;
* [Issue:[#280](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/280)] The debug plug-ins validation logic prevent the debug configuration to be saved if mandatory fields are missing, by disabling the **Apply** button, but they did not display any reason why the button is disabled; to help the user understand which fields are field, an error message was added;
* [Issue:[#281](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/281)] The RISC-V **Settings** page was updated; the `-mstrict-align` was added as a combo, the `-mtune=generic` was deprecated, and `-mtune=size` was added;
* [Issue:[#283](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/283)] Recent macOS and GNU/Linux versions of SEGGER J-Link were extended with GUI versions for the JLinkGDBServer, and the command line binaries were renamed `JLinkGDBServerCL`; the default in the J-Link debug plug-in was changed to reflect this new program name;
* [Issue:[#285](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/285)] Due to sever availability, sometimes the CMSIS packs update process fails, and a message box is displayed allowing the user to retry or ignore; to improve user experience, an **Ignore All** button was added;
* [Issue:[#275](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/275)] The RISC-V Settings page was improved; `ilp32e`  was added to the list of accepted ABIs.

## Addressed bugs

* [Issue:[#291](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/291)] Non managed projects still displayed the **Toolchain** tabs in the **Settings** page, although the definitions are not relevant for them; the **Toolchain** tab is now shown only for managed projects;
* [Issue:[#290](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/290)] The **Devices** tab was displayed in the **Settings** page even for projects not using ARM devices; the **Devices** tab is now shown only for ARM managed projects;
* [Issue:[#287](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/287)] In certain conditions, checking for the `package.json` file while processing the peripheral definitions triggered an exception; fixed;
* [Issue:[#286](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/286)] In certain conditions, the new logic used to identify SVD vs XSVD files failed when the SVD file used Unicode BOM, and the Peripherals View was empty; fixed;
* [Issue:[#278](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-plugins/issues/278)] In certain conditions, the logic behind the peripheral view triggered some NLS warnings in console; fixed;

## Template changes

* The SiFive templates were updated to the latest versions of the C/C++ xPacks; the same templates are now also available for command line usage as [@sifive/templates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sifive/templates).
